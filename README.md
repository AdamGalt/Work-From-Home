# Work-From-Home

A collection of scripts to make working from home easier by setting up your work environment automatically.

If you have trouble defining your work hours when you are working at home these scripts are intended to help you start and stop working on time by opening and closing your work programs at scheduled times.

Linux scripts are intended to be scheduled with cron.
Windows scripts with Task Scheduler.

These can also be run manually if desired.
